# The (unofficial) SQLite package registry

Given the vast amount of SQLite extensions, it's only logical to have a package registry. So here it is.

The registry contains only package metadata (specs). Package binaries and sources are located elsewhere (usually in the package developer's repositories).

Here is what you can do from here:

-   Search the registry at [sqlpkg.org](https://sqlpkg.org/).
-   Install extensions using the [sqlpkg](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlpkg-cli) package manager.
-   Add your own package to the registry.

Note that you don't have to add your package to the registry for `sqlpkg` to work with it â€” it will work just fine with your own repo (see the `sqlpkg` documentation for details). Adding your package to the registry is completely optional.
